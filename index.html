    I've done some warm-ups to find something compelling for the Hubway Visualization Challenge. Each asks a question and tries to find an answer, and builds on previous
    experiments.

    <ol>
      <li>Q: Where are the Hubway stations? <a href="001-basic">Answer with a map</a></li>
      <li>Q: How are the start/end pairs distributed throughout the rides? <a href="002-connections">Answer with an interactive map</a></li>
      <li>Q: Which stations are sources of rides and which are sinks? <a href="003-sources-and-sinks">Answer by putting bars over each station</a></li>
    </ol>
