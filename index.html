    I've done some warm-ups to find something compelling for the Hubway Visualization Challenge. Each asks a question and tries to find an answer, and builds on previous
    experiments.

    <ol>
      <li>Q: Where are the Hubway stations?</li>
      <li>Q: How are the start/end pairs distributed throughout the rides?</li>
      <li>Q: Which stations are sources of rides and which are sinks?</li>
      <li>Q: Which neighborhoods can we expect to actually see a Hubway bike moving about?</li>
    </ol>
